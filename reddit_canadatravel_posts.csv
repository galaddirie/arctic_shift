jk1v9q,Flight Cancellation. Am I eligible for a refund?,"Hey!

\*Not sure if this is the right place to post this\*\*

I booked a flight through cheapoair from Vancouver to Toronto leaving Dec 22nd.  The flight is with air transat.   

I got an email from cheapoair stating there was a change in my itinerary, and to call customer support.  (Air Transat has already changed the itinerary once, and so much so that I then needed to book hotels on both ends of my trip so I could make it to the airport in time  (coming from Victoria)).  

After cheapo air support confirmed it was cancelled, they then said that I could be switched to an Air Canada flight, but needed to contact Air Transat to deal with the cancellation.

After talking to Air Transat support, they said I was provided with a credit for the flight.

The issue is that they don't have any flights running until at least the end of January.  

The rep also didn't know why cheapo air would say I would be put on an Air Canada flight, considering it looks like I just have a credit sitting under my name in their system.  Credit I can't use with Air Canada. 

Am I entitled to a refund in this situation?  

I just wanna see my family dog for christmas lol.  

&#x200B;

15zf8uk,Will AirTransat let me take an earlier flight?,"
I'm flying YYZ to London Gatwick next week.

My plans are being derailed by the upcoming train strike in the UK.

I want to take the 7pm flight instead of the 10:45pm so I can catch a connection. (Train connection is no longer an option).

Air Transat customer service agents have told me that I can try showing up at the airport for an earlier flight to ""see what happens"", but they have no idea.

They can't update my flight on their end.

Do you guys have any idea if Air Transat staff will allow passengers to get bumped up to an earlier flight?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadatravel/comments/15zf8uk/will_airtransat_let_me_take_an_earlier_flight/,2023-08-23 16:14:16,EthicalExpert,canadatravel

192uk7l,Flight change means I may not make my connecting flight.,"I am flying into Toronto (AirTransat) and on to Vancouver with (Porter air operated by Airtransat) and my flight has been changed so that my transfer time has been reduced down to 50 mins from around 3.5 hours. Because I have to clear customs I'm not hopeful I will make the connection. 

Flights were booked together via Expedia and are on one ticket. Expedia basically told me I can cancel the full journey (not part of it) or they can move my flight forward 15 plus hours, which isn't ideal as I'd miss work. I booked this flight primarily because it was the only one that had a comfortable amount of time for the connecting flight. Most others were also sub 1 hour so I paid a premium for it. 

Does anyone have any advice on how best to proceed? I'm game to go for it, but if connection is missed will Porter be liable to accommodate and feed me for the night or will that fall to my Amex insurance. Alternative flights don't work in my favour so cancellation isn't really worth it. Airlines seem to be saying everything is out of their control these days so I'm not sure where I stand.

1akbjrw,"Monos Carry-On vs Carry-On Plus, Air Transat","Has anyone used the Monos Carry-On and/or Carry-On Plus on an Air Transat flight and encountered any problems at the airport when checking in?

The Air Transat dimensions for carry on luggage are: 9 in x 16 in x 20 in (23 cm x 40 cm x 51 cm)

The Monos Carry-On dimensions are: 22 in Ã— 14 in Ã— 9 in, and 39.9 L

The Monos Carry-On Plus dimensions are: 23 in Ã— 15 in Ã— 9.5 in, and 48 L

The Carry-On Plus is slightly larger than the airline dimensions so Iâ€™m worried that they might force me to check the bag when I really donâ€™t want to. I like the Carry-On Plus since itâ€™s almost 10 L more but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth the risk. Any recommendations? Should I just stick with the Carry-On and not risk it?

FYI, I live in Canada and am heading to Europe in the spring but this will be a bag for years to come so not just strictly Canada to Europe and vice versa.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadatravel/comments/1akbjrw/monos_carryon_vs_carryon_plus_air_transat/,2024-02-06 09:52:03,literally_rotting,canadatravel

Leaving tonight for France for three weeks and we forgot to add our checked bags to the booking more than 24h before departure. 

Now, I can't add checked bags to the booking online now. I called them and they said to go to the airport and do it there but it's ""subject to availability"" of course.

Anyone have experience with this fare on this airline? I'm sure they'll let us pay for checked bags at the airport.... Right? I just hope it won't be too expensive, extortion pricing.

1dfy484,Air Transat not warning about hotel renovations before booking?,"Last march I booked a family vacation at an all inclusive in cancun with air transat for a late June  departure.  This week I noticed the reviews on trip advisor were  pretty negative because of major renovations in the lobby area.   This was not specified when I booked.  I contacted transat CS yesterday about this and they told me not to worry about it and the renovation would be completed June 15th,  before our arrival.   
Today I received an email from transat titled HOTEL ADVISORY saying mother hotel would be under renovations until October.   
Talked to transat cs again and was told they are not responsible for hotels.
This is infuriating because had I known about this I would have booked an other hotel, and they are not giving me that option.   I feel like my $7,000 vacation is ruined and I didn't even leave yet.

1dyc6r2,Air Canada or Air Transat in winter ,"Iâ€™ll be flying to Lyon (France) in December and I can not decide between air Transat or Air Canada.

Air Transat : direct flight Quebec city - Paris then Iâ€™ll have to take the train to Lyon with my luggage

Air Canada: Quebec city - Montreal/ Montreal-Lyon

I am mostly worried about flights being cancelled because of the weather. Air Canada seems to have more options if that would happen / quicker alternatives than Air Transat but I add a layover in Montreal with Air Canada so it is an added risk of cancellation. 

Price is the same. Air Canada offers better Travel dates for me. I do not care about confort tbh, just want to arrive as planned and not miss a day!

1e9jz1d,What are my next steps for compensation from Air Transat?,"Howdy all,

  
I've tried to post this on the APPR facebook group but mods haven't approved it so seeking help through other avenues.

  
The timeline is as follows: My family and I were scheduled to leave YYZ to Punta Cana on June 29 at 9am. We got a notification on June 25th that our flight was delayed 12 hours to 9:15pm.

I asked Air Transat via messenger what the issue was and all they said was that it was for ""operational reasons"" and they had no further information to share (I took screenshots). I submitted a claim to Air Transat and this is what they've sent me: 

""Last-minute operational constraints within our fleet have forced us to change the type of aircraft operating your flight. Given the reduction in total seat capacity on the new aircraft, we have offered you a replacement flight. As indicated in the change notification sent, you had the option of accepting the proposed alternative or cancelling your booking with a refund via the same method of payment on file. As this change is not attributable to a cancellation or commercial oversale of the flight originally booked, you are not eligible for compensation.""

In the original email, they didn't ""offer"" me a chance to accept or get a full refund. They only sent me new itinerary details. There was a link at the very bottom that said ""change, modify, cancel itinerary"" but that's a link that's regularly sent whenever you book a flight.

My family and I are entitled to $1,000 each correct? I've heard CTA filing takes forever and it's counterproductive. I live in BC, but they live in Ontario. Should I go to small claims? Any help is appreciated!

  
Thank you.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadatravel/comments/1e9jz1d/what_are_my_next_steps_for_compensation_from_air/,2024-07-22 13:26:12,Busy_Hearing2737,canadatravel
1e9o2we,AirTransat doesn't include checked baggage on the connecting flight with Porter,"We're flying from London Gatwick to Calgary next week. We fly to Toronto first and then take a connecting flight to Calgary. We booked the whole thing with AirTransat including the option Plus which allows for seat choosing and checked baggage per person. The connecting flight is with Porter airlines which they say is their 'partner' carrier.

We have just found out completely by chance that our checked baggage that we paid for is only on the first leg and not all the way. It does not say that anywhere, when we booked we got confirmation of the option plus and checked baggage for (what we obviously assumed) was the entire journey. Now we called them up because they suddenly removed our option plus/checked baggage and refunded us (why, god knows) and we called to add it back on again. That's all fine. Then the guy on the phone suddenly says oh yeah you need to get in touch with Porter Airlines and pay them again to include checked baggage. WTF?

He is no help, no explanation why. Our booking is with airtransat not porter. We paid for checked baggage from london to calgary and now we're being fleeced of more money getting in touch with an airline we have had no dealings with, no booking confirmation with (it's all with transat)

Is this normal? How can they do this? Who would check their baggage for only one leg of a journey? What would have happened to our bags if we had not found this out until we got to Toronto? I'm so pissed off and really feel like this can't possibly be right.
