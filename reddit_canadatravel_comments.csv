i1wkgfw,,"You would probably be going into one of the London airports and getting a bus or train. Stansted is probably closest but not sure is any of the Canada flights go there. Heathrow is the biggest one and is to the East of London  and Gatwick is also a possibility but is South of London. Manchester might also be a possibility but connections from London are probably better.

It is worth also calling up the airline to see what days they do direct flights - I went to Calgary last month and Air Canada only have 2 direct flights each way a week. With all the options that pop up I found it easier to call up to confirm which days were direct before I decided my days.

I’d check Westjet and Air Transat but there weren’t any showing when I went - maybe they change the routes seasonally? Air Canada should be an option and maybe British Airways (BA) although they may be a bit more.",0,/r/canadatravel/comments/tlvmug/traveling_to_cambridge_uk/i1wkgfw/,2022-03-24 03:38:06,WobblyBob75,canadatravel

jtk9zy0,,"Skiplagged often has the best deals. But always look when someone new is adding service, because they often will put in new deals. But be CAREFUL, they have special fares including fares that aren't a single ticket, so you have to pick up your luggage and connect on your own and you can be screwed if you miss a connection. And they have fares with hidden cities, where you can't check luggage! Be VERY careful. 

Also the first flight of the year and the last flight of the year for charters are often well discounted. So check dates for these flights on companies like Air Transat, Neos, Azores, Corsair, Level, Sata and Play. Small airlines often are looking to hook people through.

You can also look based on length of desired trip on Google Flights and put in a 1 week or 2 week trip. So, it showed me that a flight from Ljubljana to YYZ (Toronto) for 16th to the 30th of November is €610 via Frankfurt on Lufthansa/Condor.",0,/r/canadatravel/comments/15aau2s/whats_the_cheapest_way_to_get_to_canada_from/jtk9zy0/,2023-07-26 15:18:24,MightyManorMan,canadatravel
karr9el,,">How picky is Air Transat with carry-on sizes?

You roll the dice everytime you're above the limit. People bring oversized carry-ons onto a place ALL the time, but it only takes on time for you to be asked to pay or your luggage tagged.

As such, I only buy international sized carry-ons (19""), but to be truthful, even those suitcases are *just* slightly too large for most Canadian/International airlines.

leojuw5,,"That's frustrating, mate. Travel hiccups can be a nightmare! Sometimes airlines have convoluted policies. Best bet is to escalate the issue with both AirTransat and Porter, ideally in writing for records. Always confirm these details early on next time. Don't let it ruin your trip; you’ve got this!

According to the website eco budget tickets doesn’t allow you to make changes:

If you’re unlikely to change your plans and can fit everything into a carry-on, keep it simple and splurge those discretionary funds on travel instead.

lfz93p7,,"Just about every major airline that has a ""vacation"" wing (Air Canada Vacations, for example) that will gladly take your money...

By large group, do you mean 20 people, or do you mean 100 people?

Contact AC vacations, Air Transat, Westjet, and Sunwing, and one of them will have a better price to be sure.  

At this point in time, no airline is a sure thing, and although Sunwing is probably in the worst shape, but AC and Westjet are also struggling to keep flights on time or free of cancelation.",0,/r/canadatravel/comments/1ehgmy8/any_other_companies_like_sunwing/lfz93p7/,2024-08-01 10:17:16,brucenicol403,canadatravel
lfzllg9,,"I've sent clients on every one of Canada's Tour Operators, most often on Air Canada Vacations, Air Transat and Sunwing/WestJet (they are now the same company). 

I've had issues at times with all of them but I've also had very smooth experiences with all of them, most of the time. The number one and two reasons people choose one over the other is generally price and availability. 

For example, if you want to go to a RIU, you are going on Sunwing, end of story because they have an exclusivity agreement. Other times, the same room is offered by all three major tour operators but for different prices because flights can vary, so do your homework. 

If you want some help or advice, feel free to DM me. I book tonnes of All-Inclusive resorts for families and groups, every year. Working with an agent also means you have one throat to choke instead of chasing the airline and/or hotel and tour operator. 

Good luck and safe travels!",0,/r/canadatravel/comments/1ehgjum/other_companies_like_sunwing/lfzllg9/,2024-08-01 11:25:32,benny2012,canadatravel
lhlfihq,,"We just returned from a trip to UK with AirTransat and will not book with them again. Sole reason: size of carry on shenanigan. They know full well that a typical carry on is about an inch bigger than their made up restriction so it's a shameful money grab on their end and for this only reason which caused us added complications, we will not book with them again. The small difference in ticket costs between them and AC (AC went on sale two weeks after we got our AT tickets) does not justify the added troubles.
